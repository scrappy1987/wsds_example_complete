--------------------Install nodejs------------------------

OPTIONAL - If nodejs is not yet installed, then complete the following.

Install nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/, which should give you npm access.

To test that node has installed successfully, in a command window enter the following

        npm


------------------Install node module dependencies-------

Open a command window at the PAMM seed root folder and enter the following

        npm install

Provided there are no issues with your proxy, this should install all the required dependencies defined in the
package.json file.

To run the unit tests with karma, open command window at the PAMM seed root folder and enter the following command

        npm run jasmine-test
