        <p> Click on the sample tab to see a sample list implementation. On the "Manage Project" page - you will a list
            of
            sample data. This list of data comes from the repository and the (mock) DAL service. See service/repository
            and
            service/dal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The DAL service is where you implement connection to the back end. Currently, there is a mock implementation
            for
            demonstration purpose. (Note: it is not good practice to put mocks alongside real code. Future releases of
            this seed, we will use external configuration to switch.
        </p>

        <p>
            Both the DAL and Repository services use <i>decorator</i> to implement separation of concerns. See examples
            in
            the service directory.
